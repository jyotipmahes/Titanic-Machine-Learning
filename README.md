# Titanic-Machine-Learning
This repo is my attempt to explore the field of Machine learning by working on Kaggle competition relating to Titanic Data Set.
Titanic data set is considered as a de facto data set to start machine learning and learn how classification works. In this project, i have employed R to explore the data set,identify important features, impute missiong values using `mice` package and also linear regression whever necessary. After cleaning the data and extracting key features, i have employed various classification techniques such as logistic regression, random forest and SVM to benchmark thier performances and run prediction on test data. The final model yields a score of ~.75. This repo is more about getting started in the field of data science, feature engineering and building an end to end model rather then building complex models and competing.
